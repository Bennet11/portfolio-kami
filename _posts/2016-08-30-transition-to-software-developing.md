Software Developing is a product of deep reflection as i decide where my path is and a little bit of practicality. Software developing wasn't even in my radar up until this year.

I studied Bachelor of Science Major in Legal Management at San Beda College, Manila, Philippines. It is nowhere near being a software developer even the aforementioned school offers Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I wanted to be a lawyer, it was my first dream. I was a prospect of being the first lawyer in my family. So i went to proceed and take the ideal preparatory course for law school, BS Legal Management. I graduated on 2013 and went straight to law school.

My first half in law school went smoothly, all went according to plan and i was on my momentum at that time. I was able to finish my first year however, due to some unfortunate events i failed to meet the requirements to proceed to sophomore level. It left a huge impact on me since i wanted to graduate as lawyer bearing the name of that particular school.

Those chain of events lead to my decision to fly to United States to be reunited with my family and start all over again. Again, i was planning on continuing my dream as lawyer here in United States. But as i discussed the matter with some of my friends, they gave me an advice that the legal field is struggling at this point in time. Services of lawyers are not needed as it used to be due to the rising practice of outsourcing. I then went to reflect on myself on whether or not i will still pursue my dream as a lawyer.

Although i'm already reflecting in myself, i never stopped consulting other friends with regards to the trending careers in the USA. One of my friends then suggested that i should take web developing or try going into "bootcamps". It all started when she noticed that i spend a lot of time in front of my computer. I'm a gamer and still a gamer at present. She said that my passion of being a computer guy would definitely help me in coding bootcamps and she was right. She suggested bloc since she's an alumnus of the same. And that's how it started.
