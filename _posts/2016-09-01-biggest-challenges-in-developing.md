title: Challenges in Developing
---

This transition is quite difficult for me at first. All the terms, inputs and methods are really new to me since i've never tried developing before except in codeacademy which is a brief tutorial. Familiarizing on how models, controllers and html's integrate or work with each other took me a while. It's really frustrating to get stuck in an error and to get another error after troubleshooting the previous one.

I usually get errors on my routes, nested routes to be exact. I also have trouble on my controllers since you need to configure unique actions which differs from project to project. As for models, i usually get problems when i need to define additional attributes or functions. And last but not the least, challenges of model relationships are sometimes unforgiving, especially with has_many_to_many relationships since you need to create a couple of models to associate the same thus adding work.


Some projects differ from each otherHowever as i progress through my work, little by little, i start to understand some of the concepts. For me, the biggest challenge so far is that developing is vast that i get this feeling that i'm still on the tip of an iceberg.
