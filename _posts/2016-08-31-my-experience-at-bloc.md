title: My Experience at Bloc
---

My experience with bloc has been very very smooth. As i inquire about the programs offered in bloc and even inquired about the assurance the bloc would refund the tuition in case students wont be able to land in a job in a period of time. That assurance is one of the good reasons i chose bloc over other bootcamps. It shows how confident bloc is on their curriculum. They know students would definitely learn from them and the mentors they provide by making a risky assurance so they impress me for a bit.

I like how programs work in bloc, even though i have the full control of my curriculum since first, it is an online class, i do not need to go to a campus several miles from my house. It's hassle-free to be in short. What i only need is to make sure that i keep on working to finish my checkpoints so i have something to discuss with my mentor. And in case a problem arises as i progress through my work. Mentors are just one email/message away and they'll reply as soon as possible.

As far as mentors are concerned, i really like the mentor's they've given me so far. The mentors are dedicated, not only that they answer most of my question if not all, they even give additional tips on how to make my work easier. They push and motivate you and even give you sample interview questions. So far, my experiences with my mentors are above my expectations.

As for the curriculum, it provides you the necessary lecture that you actually need in order to work, they give enough details as to providing example as well. Although some sections are lengthy, it's comprehensible. The assignments really help you since it actually gives you more ideas on what to add on your work.
